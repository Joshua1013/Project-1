    <h3> Deadliest Creatures on Supernatural </h3>
<h4> Angels </h4>
  <p>Angels are created by God himself to protect heaven and earth. Then are one of the most powerful creatures on the planet earth. Also supernatural has a different kind of angels called archangels. Their was only 4 arcangels, Michael,Lucifer,Raphael, and Gabriel. These 4 brothers contains angelic powers that surpasses demons and other angels. Angel and archangels can outmatch most of the creatures ever created. The only beings that can outmatch them are Leviathans and the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse (Death,Famine,War and Pestilence). The first angel (Castiel) appeared in Season 4 Episode 1, angels started appearing due to demons. In order for an angel to appear on earth it needs to have a human body (vessle) to possess. Even though angels seem like the dominant creature basically anyone can kill it with this special angel blade.  </p>

  <h4> Demons </h4>
   <p>Demons are basically the opposites of angels. Demons can basically do all the horrible things they want to do in life. Instead of angels asking permission to posses a vessel demons can literally steal any vessel unless the human is warded by a special anti-possesion warding tattoo. Like angels having archangels, demons have a high tier class called the knights of hell. The knight of hell include 3 people, Cain,Abadon, and Dean (Spoiler Alert, he becomes a demon). The reason why these knights are unique is that they have been trained by Cain the original knight, these demons have been around for many of years except dean. To kill a demon you can use 1 of two speical blade, the angel blade or the demon-killing knife. This demon knife can kill any demon and hellhound besides the knights.</p>

 <h4> Four Horsemen </h4>
 <p> The Four Horsemen of the Apocolypse are one of the powerest creatures ever created, The Four Horsemen contain War,Famine,Pestilence, and Death. The Horsemen appears when Lucifer is once freed from his cage. These horsemen contain 4 rings. Each of the rings gives them their powers, but without it weakens them. Death, is basically the grim reaper he can kill anyone with his scythe and he claims he might of been older than god. Death also controlls all of the reapers, these reapers are what you see when you're about to die and they take your soul at the end. War basically creates havock between people, he can manipulate on how people see things. At his first appearence he made people think each other were demons, this made people kill each other until Sam and Dean figured out what was going on. Next up is Pestilence, he spreads all sorts of diseases,plagues, etc. The last horsemen is Famine, like his name he can make people crave the food they want and then he takes their souls, only way to defeat him is by removing his ring. </p>

<h4> Leviathans </h4>
  <p> Leviathans are one of the scariest creatures on supernatural and one of the strongest villans Sam and Dean has ever faced. Leviathans originated from pugatory, God put them in purgatory because they were to evil but they ended up on earth, due to Castiel and Crowely. Leviathans were ruled by a person named Richard Roman, but this wasn't the real Richard, a Leviathan secretly killed him and shapeshifted into him. These species disapperaed after Dean and Castiel ended up killing Richard, but in doing so they ended up in purgatory with all sorts of monster from vampires to leviathans. </p>
