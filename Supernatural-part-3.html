<h3> Angels <h3>
  <p>Angels are created by God himself to protect heaven and earth. Then are one of the most powerful creatures on the planet earth. Also supernatural has a different kind of angels called archangels. Their was only 4 arcangels, Michael,Lucifer,Raphael, and Gabriel. These 4 brothers contains angelic powers that surpasses demons and other angels. Angel and archangels can outmatch most of the creatures ever created. The only beings that can outmatch them are Leviathans and the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse (Death,Famine,War and Pestilence). The first angel (Castiel) appeared in Season 4 Episode 1, angels started appearing due to demons. In order for an angel to appear on earth it needs to have a human body (vessle) to possess. Even though angels seem like the dominant creature basically anyone can kill it with this special angel blade.  </p>

<h3> Demons <h3>
   <p>Demons are basically the opposites of angels. Demons can basically do all the horrible things they want to do in life. Instead of angels asking permission to posses a vessel demons can literally steal any vessel unless the human is warded by a special anti-possesion warding tattoo. Like angels having archangels, demons have a high tier class called the knights of hell. The knight of hell include 3 people, Cain,Abadon, and Dean (Spoiler Alert, he becomes a demon). The reason why these knights are unique is that they have been trained by Cain the original knight, these demons have been around for many of years except dean. To kill a demon you can use 1 of two speical blade, the angel blade or the demon-killing knife. This demon knife can kill any demon and hellhound besides the knights.</p>
