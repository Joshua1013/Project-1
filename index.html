    <p> If you are planing to watch this amazing show, DO IT!!. So far this show has 11 seasons, Season 12 will be airing on my birthday, October 13. Supernatural is one of the best shows I've seen. The show is basically two brothers Sam and Dean Winchester trying to fight monsters like vampires, demons, angles,ghost, basically everything that is in books and fables. In the beginning the two brothers has a dad, John who had his wife killed by a demon. After a couple of years he wanted to track down who killed her and he trained his kids how to fight/kill all sorts of monsters. Then all of a sudden, John Winchester hasn't been home for a while tring to track demons.</p>

    <h3>Sam</h3>
    <p>Sam is the youngest person in the family. He wasn't really interested into hunting monsters. All he really wanted to do in his life is to finish college and marry his wife Jessica. While his dad was gone Dean wanted help trying to find their own dad. Sam refused but then his girlfriend then died to the same demon who killed their mom (Azazel). Sam couldn't face the fact that his girlfriend died, so he decided to join Dean on getting vengeance.</p>
